## Problem Statement

Utilize employee health and lifestyle data to implement a reward system that promotes a healthy lifestyle among employees. This involves two key objectives: first, identify employees who demonstrate healthy behaviors and low absenteeism to receive a $1,000 bonus under the healthy bonus program. Second, calculate an equitable distribution of a total insurance budget of $983,221 for wage increases or annual compensation specifically for non-smokers, aiming to incentivize non-smoking behaviors and overall wellness.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a SQL file.
- Step 2 : Three card visuals were added to the canvas with the first one representing average absenteeism time in hours 
- Step 3 : Four Donut chart visuals were added to the canvas with the first one representing count of education, the second one representing count of social smoker, the third one representing count of pet, and the fourth one representing count of social drinker
- Step 4 : Two line chart visuals were added, one representing absenteeism in hours by month of absence & other representing absenteeism in hours by day of the week   
- Step 5 : A table visual was added representing reason and count of reason
- Step 6 : In the table "count of reason" was clicked to make sure the values are descending; A gradient was also added to the visual
- Step 7 : A scatterplot visual was added to the canvas to represent average of transportation expense by workload average/day
- Step 8 : A smart narrative visual was added to explain what is on the canvas

From this point on, different graphics were utilized to assist with the dashboards cohesiveness

- Step 9 : The report was then published to Power BI Service

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Employee and Categories

Pie charts display the distribution of absenteeism by tags such as education, smoking status, drinking status and pet. This helps in identifying patterns or trends in absenteeism across different employee segments
           
### [2] Time and Trends

  Graphs show absenteeism trends over months and days of the week. Absenteeism seems to peak in certain months and varies significantly by the day of the week, with Monday and Friday showing higher instances.
  
  ### [3] Reasons and Comparisons
  
A bar graph lists various reasons for absenteeism such as medical consultations, dental consultations, and diseases, giving an idea of the most common causes of absence.
This can help in understanding the root causes of absenteeism and address them directly

 ### [4] Average Transportation Expense by Workload
 
 This scatter plot correlates transportation expenses with average daily workload, suggesting that transportation costs increase as the workload increases. This might imply that on busier days, employees are more likely to commute using methods that incur higher expenses, possibly due to time constraints or stress levels.



Each section is critical for HR to analyze the patterns and causes of absenteeism, which can lead to better management strategies, such as wellness programs, better scheduling, finding out who receives the bonus, or other supportive measures to reduce absentee rates and increase productivity.
